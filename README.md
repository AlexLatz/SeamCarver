SeamCarver is a JavaFX application that uses the Seam Carver algorithm to scale images without distortion.

##Installation
Download the latest version of SeamCarver from the [releases page](https://github.com/AlexLatz/SeamCarver/releases/latest) and run the application (Mac, Linux) or the installer (Windows).

##Usage
Open an image using the menu, or use the default image.

Then resize the window to live-resize the image, or use the menu to set a specific size in pixels.

You can then export the image to JPEG, PNG, BMP, or GIF formats.
